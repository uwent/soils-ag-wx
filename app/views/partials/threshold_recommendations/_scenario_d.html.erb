<h4>Estimated Vector Emergence Status</h4>
<p>Based on the degree day model (Jagemann et al., 2018), it is estimated that at least 50% of <i>Colopterus truncatus</i> and 25% of <i>Carphophilus sayi </i> have emerged as of the date yet. <i>C. truncatus</i> and <i>C. sayi</i> are the two most important insects that transmit oak wilt in Wisconsin. <i>C. truncatus</i> emerges earlier in spring than <i>C. sayi.</i></p>

<p class="larger-font"> Although substantial numbers of beetles, especially <i>Carpophillus sayi</i> were trapped past July 15th, only low proportions of beetles carried viable oak wilt fungal spores after July 15th (Jagemann et al., 2018). The abundance of the two major vectors of oak wilt was investigated in Minnesota in 2002 and 2003 (Ambourn et al., 2005).  Abundance and contamination rate of <i>Colopterus truncatus</i> with the oak wilt fungal spores peaked in April and May. Abundance of <i>C. sayi</i> peaked in October, but the pathogen was most commonly isolated from beetles collected during May and June.</p>

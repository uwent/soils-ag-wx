<h2>About Us / Contact</h2>
<p style="font-size: larger">
  This web site is a continuation of the hard work first started in the mid 1980’s by Bill Bland, now emeritus faculty member and Rick Wayne, software developer in Department of Soil Science at UW – Madison. The data are provided free of charge to any interested parties. A primary focus of their mission was to help growers maximize their yields, minimize their costs, and assist them wherever possible as responsible stewards of our agricultural landscape. Bill has retired and Rick has accepted a new position so they are no longer involved with the site. John Panuska, professor in Soil Science, coordinated the site for a time, but retired in 2021.

<h4>How To Register</h4>
<p>The "Register" button below takes you to a form where you can enter your name and email address so that our weather data emails can find you. Once you're known to our database, you can add locations and subscribe them to several different kinds of weather, degree day, and pest risk model outputs. The emails will go out at 7:00 AM Central and will reflect weather data as of the prior day. In addition, your saved sites will show up on the <%= link_to "sites page", sites_path %> for quick access to recent weather data.</p>
<p>After you register, the system will send you an email containing a link which you can click to confirm that you're really you. Clicking the link will confirm your account and sign you in. In the future, you can sign in by entering your email below.</p>

<h2>Register for Automated Daily ET Values</h2>

<hr>

<p>The "Register" button below takes you to a form where you can enter your name and email address so that our automatically-emailed et values can find you. Once you're known to our database, you can sign up for locations to have et values delivered to you daily.</p>

<p>After you register, the system will send you an email containing a link which you can click to confirm that you're really you, and that you really want to start receiving automated emails.</p>
